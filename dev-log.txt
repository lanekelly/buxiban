Forking project from survivejs codebase. First UI should be a text input
to accept english form of hiragana. Trigger on enter or via button to side.
Shuffles through all of list until empty. If a word is missed, it goes back
on the list.
todo: new/reset game; add all hiragana from chapter

1/26
Desired improvements:
- ask english text, write down hiragana on paper
+ choose subsets ('k', 'n', etc)
+ add next set
- choose a # of items for quiz to limit size

2/1
Desired improvements:
- Make input lowercase and check against that
- Instead of defaulting to all groups enabled, pick one random at start.

2/11
- Trim whitespace before/after input
- Make UX more responsive for mobile
